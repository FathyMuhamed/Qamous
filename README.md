## Description
The Qamous Frontend is the client-side component of the Qamous application, a platform for users to contribute and explore definitions of Arabic and Franco-Arabic words. The frontend is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface for user authentication, word, and definition management, as well as user interactions such as liking, disliking, and reporting definitions.
